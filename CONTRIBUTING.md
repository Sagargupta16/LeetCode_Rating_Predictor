- Add proper error handling
- Include logging for debugging
- Write unit tests for new features

### Frontend (React)
- Create reusable components
- Handle loading states and errors
- Follow responsive design principles
- Test in multiple browsers

### Machine Learning
- Document model changes thoroughly
- Include validation metrics
- Consider model performance implications
- Update training notebooks as needed

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend tests (if available)
python -m pytest tests/

# Frontend tests
cd client
npm test
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Test error conditions and edge cases

## Submitting Changes

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Commit with descriptive messages:
   ```
   feat: add new rating prediction algorithm
   fix: resolve CORS issue in production
   docs: update API documentation
   ```

4. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
5. Create a Pull Request with:
   - Clear description of changes
